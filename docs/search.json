    "text": "Hi, I’m an ARC DECRA Fellow in the Macroevolution and Macroecology Group at the Australian National University. I research how environmental change shapes the origin and decline of biodiversity across the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy research explores biodiversity patterns and the evolutionary histories of the myriad plant and animal groups that shape them. I’m interested in why some areas, like tropical rainforests, consistently host high biodiversity. But I’m equally drawn to regions that challenge expectations about how biodiversity is formed, for example, the unexpectedly high diversity of reptiles in Australia’s arid zone, or the remarkable richness of endemic plant species in Mediterranean-type climates around the globe. To investigate these topics, I integrate spatial, phylogenetic, and ecological-trait data combined with simulation modeling and phylogenetic comparative methods, while also considering how global change in the past, present, and future is reshaping these systems"

This region is defined by its insularity and the thousands of islands that exist bewteen the Sunda continental shelf and the Australian mainland. The region has been shaped by historical isolation of the Indian subcontinent and Sahul and dramatic biotic interchanges upon their more recent connections with Eurasia. I am deeply interested in understanding how these dynamic tectonic processes, alongside climatic change during teh Cenozoic, have shaped the interchange of organisms in this region, shaping the diversity of different biomes from the equatorial rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra, to the monsoonal tropics of Northern Australia, and the central Australian arid zone.\n\n\n\nBiodiversity Simulation Modelling\nSimulation-based approaches to modelling the diversification of lineages allows us to link a complex array of ecological and evolutionary processes. I have been involved in developing new simulation tools (e.g., DREaD) and extending existing simulation frameworks to model novel processes (e.g., Gen3sis) in order to understand how fundamental processes such as environmental niche evolution and dispersal shape emergent biodiversity gradients. My upcoming DECRA aims at extending this toolkit for biogeographers and evolutionary biologists.\n\n\n\nPhylogenetics and Evolutionary History of the Proteaceae\nThe Proteaceae are one of the most diverse and iconic temperate plant families. They are found across large areas of the former Gondwanan southern continents and even into parts of tropical Asia. As part of my current ARC funded postdoc I have been inferring phylogenetic relationships in the large, mostly Australian subfamily, the Grevilleoideae. Using phylogenomic data, we aiming to untangling the causes of widespread discordance throughout the group and date divergences using a novel fossil dataset, in order to look at the groups biogeographic and diversification history in the context of historical biome change."
